- It is better to write down equations/tables rather than cutting them from elsewhere, e.g., page 4.
- Write more sentences in your slides to explain things rather than listing equations, e.g., page 7 and page 8.
- Make your slides explain itself so that people don't need to follow your talk to know what it is about. e.g., page 8 and page 11.



Review:


-. Page 4, before Theorem 1: explicit mathematical form of calculating (1-v)-CVaR $\varphi_{1-v}(w,b)$ is not clear.
-. Page 4, Equation 8: transition from Theorem 1 to Equation 8 is not clear. Is it from literatures?
-. Page 4, before Theorem 1: the (1-v)-tail distribution of (1-v)-CVaR does not sum to 1.
-. Page 4, Equation 8, parameter suddenly changes from v to u.
