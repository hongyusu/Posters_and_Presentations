- It is better to write down equations/tables rather than cutting them from elsewhere, e.g., page 4.
- Write more sentences in your slides to explain things rather than listing equations, e.g., page 7 and page 8.
- Make your slides explain itself so that people don't need to follow your talk to know what it is about. e.g., page 8 and page 11.
